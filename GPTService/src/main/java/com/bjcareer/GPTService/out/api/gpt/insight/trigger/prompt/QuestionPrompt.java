			+ "### Theme Background Analysis\n\n"
			+ "Question 1: Find common patterns in <reasons></reasons> and analyze the context and background of how the theme was formed.\n\n"
			+ "### Methodology\n\n"
			+ "1. Extract triggers from <reasons>:</reason>: Identify mentions of regulatory entities and policy names.\n"
			+ "   - Example: 'EU bans single-use plastics' → Regulatory Entity: EU, Policy: Plastic Ban\n"
			+ "   - Example: 'US Inflation Reduction Act subsidies for renewable energy' → Regulatory Entity: US Government, Policy: Inflation Reduction Act\n\n"
			+ "2. Cluster similar triggers:\n"
			+ "   - Group reasons by context, such as environmental policies, economic incentives, or geopolitical actions.\n"
			+ "   - Example Cluster:\n"
			+ "     - Environmental Policies: 'EU bans single-use plastics', 'Renewable energy subsidies'\n"
			+ "     - Economic Incentives: 'Electric vehicle demand due to government incentives'\n\n"
			+ "3. Analyze the context:\n"
			+ "   - Political Context: Are these triggers driven by international agreements or geopolitical tensions?\n"
			+ "   - Economic Context: Are they addressing market imbalances or driving industrial growth?\n"
			+ "   - Social Context: Do they reflect public demand or advocacy efforts?\n\n"
			+ "4. Abstract the root cause:\n"
			+ "   - Convert specific examples into general causes that explain the theme’s formation.\n"
			+ "   - Example:\n"
			+ "     - 'EU bans single-use plastics' → Root Cause: 'Global shift towards sustainability due to climate change'\n"
			+ "     - 'Renewable energy subsidies' → Root Cause: 'Government push for clean energy adoption'\n\n"
			+ "### Example Analysis\n\n"
			+ "<reasons>EU bans single-use plastics, Rising demand for electric vehicles due to government incentives, "
			+ "US Inflation Reduction Act subsidies for renewable energy</reasons>\n\n"
			+ "1. Extracted Entities and Policies:\n"
			+ "   - Regulatory Entity: EU, Policy: Single-use Plastics Ban\n"
			+ "   - Regulatory Entity: US Government, Policy: Inflation Reduction Act\n\n"
			+ "2. Clusters:\n"
			+ "   - Environmental Policies: 'EU bans single-use plastics', 'Renewable energy subsidies'\n"
			+ "   - Economic Incentives: 'Electric vehicle demand due to government incentives'\n\n"
			+ "3. Theme Formation:\n"
			+ "   - Context: Global regulatory and economic shifts to combat climate change.\n"
			+ "   - Root Cause: Climate change and sustainability efforts driving government intervention and policies.\n\n"
			+ "This approach identifies regulatory and policy-related triggers to analyze the formation of themes effectively."

			+ "Question 2: Abstract the fundamental cause of this theme's emergence.\n\n"
			+ "## Analysis and Abstraction Method\n\n"
			+ "### 1. Identify Causes from Background Knowledge\n"
			+ "   - Understand the fundamental events that led to the theme’s formation.\n"
			+ "   Example:\n"
			+ "    - 'Infrastructure destruction due to the Ukraine war.'\n"
			+ "    Designate this as the primary cause.\n\n"
			+ "### 2. Abstracting the Primary Cause\n"
			+ "   - Use the primary cause to abstract the fundamental reasons behind the theme's formation.\n"
			+ "   Example:\n"
			+ "     - 'Reconstruction theme due to the Ukraine war' → 'Reconstruction theme due to war.'\n"
