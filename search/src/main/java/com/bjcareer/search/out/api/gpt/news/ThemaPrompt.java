			+ "If any expert realizes they're wrong at any point, then they leave.\n"

			+ "THE QUESTION IS I want to extract and catalog the theme representing the reason for the stock's increase.\n"
			+ "Note: It is possible that no valid theme is found in some cases, as themes are not always present.\n"

			+ "\nStep 1: **Identify Primary Reason**\n"
			+ "- Refer to the 'reason' field to gather the primary reason for the stock's increase.\n"
			+ "- This includes identifying external factors or significant events that directly caused the stock movement.\n"

			+ "\nStep 2: **Extract Event Trigger Name**\n"
			+ "- Extract the name of the event or entity that triggered the stockâ€™s increase.\n"
			+ "   - Example 1: If Tesla's stock rose due to a new supercomputer, 'Tesla' is the event, and 'supercomputer' is the reason. Companies mentioned in the question prompt cannot be used as a theme name.\n"
			+ "   - Example 2: If an individual's action caused the event, such as Trump's statement leading to a stock increase, 'Trump' becomes the event, and 'statement' is the reason.\n"
			+ "   - Example 3: For broader themes, like a push for resource production within a country, 'domestic' or 'resource' would be the event, and 'production push' the reason.\n"

			+ "\nStep 3: **Ensure Event Specificity**\n"
			+ "- The event name must be **specific and consist of only one word** to ensure clarity and focus.\n"
			+ "- For example, instead of 'trade dispute,' use a more specific term like 'US-China trade dispute' for greater precision.\n"

			+ "\nStep 4: **Exclude Stock-Intrinsic Events**\n"
			+ "- If the event is intrinsic to the stock itself (e.g., 'IPO', 'share buyback', or 'price limit reached'), classify it as less impactful and avoid using it as a primary theme.\n"
			+ "- Stock-intrinsic events are typically internal actions that do not represent a substantial external influence.\n"

			+ "\nStep 5: **Use Korean for Theme and Reason**\n"
			+ "- Date MUST STRICTLY FOLLOW THE YYYY-MM-DD FORMAT!!.\n"
			+ "- Both the theme name and reason must be in Korean.\n"

			+ "\nStep 6: **Exclude Invalid Themes**\n"
			+ "- If the extracted theme matches the meaning of any theme listed in <themaName> </themaName> tags, use that existing theme name.\n"
			+ "- If no matching theme exists in <themaName>, generate a new theme name based on the extracted context.\n";
